# Hangman

### Description

- This program takes the user's input of letters and compares it to a randomly chosen word to see if the letters match or not.
- This program can be used to play the game of Hangman as the chosen word is gradually revealed based on if the user guesses correctly.
- The program contains if statements and for loops within while loops in order to create the chosen word and then to hide it, then the user's input is looped through each letter in the chosen word to check if there is a match or not and to display the resulting output until the user wins or loses the game.
- Once the game has been completed the user can then play the game again by effectively restarting the program, or exit the game closing the program.

### Inspiration

This is a simple program that was made as an exercise to learn how strings, chars, and loops can be used in C# with the command line.

### Getting Started

To use the program run the Hangman.exe file then input any single letter into the console window and follow the prompts.
